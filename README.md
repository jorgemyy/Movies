# Movies
For my final project for INFO 2201 at CU in Fall 2023, I analyzed movie data from four datasets (IMDB, oscar winners, OMDB API, and a composite dataset) to discuss the impact of movie run times on various other features (including critic reviews, public reviews, and movie gross for a variety of genres)

Skills developed: regular expressions, pandas, seaborn
